CHECKING FOR MISSING VALUES AND APPLYING IMPUTATION TECHNIQUES

APPLYING FOR LABEL ENCODER FOR LABEL COLUMN

CHECKING FOR OUTLIERS IN ALL THE COLUMN USING BOXPLOT AND CHANGING OUTLIERS TO APPROPRIATE RANGE

CHECKING FEATURE IMPORTANCE USING CORRELATION MATRIX AND RETAINING ONLY THE ONES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

USING PCA/LDA TO REDUCE DIMENSIONS AND AS A FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE SO AS TO RETAIN

USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT IS CAPABLE OF MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION

LOGISTIC REGRESSION
SVM
RANDOM FOREST
NUERAL NETWORK
MAKING USE OF PERFORMANCE METRICES
MAKING SENSE FROM DATA

THERE ARE COLUMNS WITH 0 AT THE BEGINNING THEN THERE ARE COLUMNS WITH 1 AT BEGINNIG

ASSUMPTION - GOING THROUGH TERRABLUE STORY PAGE I CAME TO ASSUMPTION THAT THIS DATA SET IS SOMEWHAT RELATED TO CHARATERSTICS OR MAYBE PARAMETER RELATED TO EPILEPSY AND WITH LABEL IN TERMS OF SEVERE MILD EPILEPSY

0 FOR NOT A SEIZURE 1 FOR SEIZURE


MAKES SENSE THAT THERE IS LESS DATA FOR ( HAVING SEIZURE ) AND MORE DATA FOR NOT HAVING SEIZURE




# OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE RANDOM FOREST
MODEL OF CHOICE RANDOM FOREST

> Precision for FF NN QQ is 1.00, which means that all instances predicted are actually FF NN QQ ,

> Recall for VEBER is 0.98, indicating that 98 per of actual VEBER instances were correctly classified.

> The F1-score for VEBER is 0.97,indicating a good balance between precision and recall.

> Support: Support represents the number of instances in each class in the test set.

> Accuracy: The accuracy is 1 , which means the model predicted the correct class for 100 per of the instances.

> Macro avg and weighted avg: These values represent the average of precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes
